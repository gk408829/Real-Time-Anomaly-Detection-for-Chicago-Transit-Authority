# Docker Setup Status

## Current Status: ✅ WORKING & CLEANED UP

The Docker containerization is working and the project has been cleaned up. Here's the current state:

### ✅ Fixed Issues
1. **Network timeouts during pip install** - Resolved with timeout settings and batched installs
2. **File path mismatches** - Fixed directory structure in containers
3. **Missing system dependencies** - Added required packages for geospatial libraries
4. **Python import paths** - Corrected module paths and PYTHONPATH
5. **Container build optimization** - Created layered builds for better caching

### 🚀 Working Components

#### Mock API (Currently Running)
- **Status**: ✅ Healthy and responding
- **URL**: http://localhost:8000
- **Purpose**: Test Docker setup without model dependencies
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /` - Service info
  - `GET /health` - Health check (returns `model_loaded: false` - this is expected)
  - `GET /test` - Test endpoint
  - `GET /docs` - API documentation

#### Container Location on macOS
Your containers are stored in Docker Desktop's VM:
```bash
# Container data location
~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/vms/0/data/docker/

# Your project volumes are mounted from:
./data/     -> /app/data (in container)
./models/   -> /app/models (in container)
```

```

### 🧹 Cleanup Completed
- Removed duplicate API files (app_mock.py, app_safe.py, start_api.py)
- Consolidated requirements files into single requirements.txt
- Removed unnecessary Docker files (minimal, dev variants)
- Cleaned up .DS_Store files
- Simplified project structure

### 🔧 Available Commands

```bash
# Start the system
./scripts/docker-start.sh

# Stop the system
./scripts/docker-stop.sh

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f

# Check API health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Test API endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/test

# Production deployment
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Start the system**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/docker-start.sh
   ```

2. **Train a model** (to enable real predictions):
   ```bash
   # Open and run the modeling notebook
   jupyter lab src/notebooks/02-Modeling.ipynb
   ```

3. **Collect real data**:
   ```bash
   python src/data_collection/fetch_data.py
   ```

4. **Production deployment**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

### 🔍 Verification

Current mock API is responding correctly:
- Health endpoint: `{"status":"healthy","model_loaded":false}`
- Test endpoint: `{"message":"Docker setup is working!"}`

The `model_loaded: false` is **expected** for the mock API - it indicates the Docker setup is working but we're not loading the actual ML model (which requires additional dependencies).

### 🚨 Important Notes

- **Mock vs Real**: Currently using mock API for testing Docker setup
- **Model Dependencies**: Real API needs LightGBM and model file
- **Network Issues**: Resolved with timeout settings and batched installs
- **Container Storage**: Data persists in mounted volumes, containers are ephemeral
